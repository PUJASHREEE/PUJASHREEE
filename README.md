We are the Team Krenoviantz from Sri Krishna College of Engineering and Technology; Coimbatore and we would like to present our idea on Virtual Reality based Science Laboratories for School Education.
**Problem Statement:**
to inculcate the virtual reality in field of education and feel the experience of reality
**VIRTUAL REALITY:** A technology that allows us to step outside of the physical world’s limitations and enter into a realm of infinite possibilities. We have come up with an application to ignite the minds of students with this tool of virtual reality.
Basically, the Virtual Reality box is a device that opens the door into a world of wonder and helps a student experience different subjects over interactive environments. 
We’ve customized the VR box with the use of 3D printing technology to make it compatible and efficient with our developed application.
Our application works on the basis of Fovea Gaze Interaction. When the fovea of our eye concentrates over a point for five consecutive seconds, it enters into that particular laboratory.
**BIOLOGY:**
Talking about the biology laboratory, we’ve incorporated the components of a human cell, the DNA, and the basic skeleton structures along with some of its internal organs. It provides the name of the part along with its specific functions.
**MRI:**
Magnetic Resonance Imaging, basically called as MRI scanning used in the field of medicine, is a technology that provides crystal clear imaging of the internal functioning units. Our laboratory gives a detailed interpretation of its working and the principle behind. 
**PLANETARIUM:**
Zillions of stars burning, millions of galaxies floating around and the planets revolving over the orbits, our planetarium gives the students an intuition to connect themselves and learn more about the interstellar bodies.
**CHEMISTRY:**
While taking a hands-on experience with chemicals can sometimes turn hazardous, the VR based chemistry laboratory sets the stage for the students to witness the reactions without actually getting exposed to them.
**EXIT:**
All the laboratories are designed in such a way that, there will be an exit door with the help of which the user can get back to the home screen. The handling of the application is fabricated in a very simpler way just with gyroscopic walk and gaze interaction mechanism.
**FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS:**
There are multiple fields which can be further added in the future development of this application to improvise the virtual reality learning.
**Yoga Tutor:**
Sitting at your home but getting to a beach or a seashore, no human interaction but getting a yoga tutor to guide you, practicing the postures at any time you are convenient. Are all these possible?
Yes, it is! With the help of this VR application in the future we may use Artificial Intelligence to develop a yoga tutor and make them guide the user in performing the postures. We can also swap the environment in the virtual reality for the user to get a peace of mind, just by sitting at home.
**Atomic Structure:**
We know that the graphite of pencil has Carbon atoms within it but it is not possible to visualize those atoms with our naked eyes and virtual reality makes this possible. It also allows us to disassemble an atom or fabricate an atom on our own.
**Nuclear Fission**:
We have heard that a nuclear fission is highly explosive and destructive. It is inevitable to stand into a nuclear fission and encounter the catastrophe happening. VR stages a platform to get into that world and fantasize how does a nuclear fission occur. 
**ADVANTAGES:**
We have also made the application well protected to the human eyes for a longer time access with LPRF screen rays protector. 
The VR box also has a cushion to wear it for a longer time.-
